1.Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
version control tracks changes to files over time,allowing multiple people to work on a project without losing progress.Git is the most commonly used version control system and github is aplatform that stores projects online.
Github keeps record of all changes,prevents accidental data loss,allows multiple people and works well with other tools


2.Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps, and what are some of the important decisions you must make during this process?
Log into github.com
click the + in the top right and select new repository
enter a repository name
choose public or private
add a readme file
add a licence

3.Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
it explains what the project is about and it should include the project name and description, how to install and use the the project ,screenshots and examples ,contributor names and licence details

4.Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
Feature	Public Repo	Private Repo
Who can see?	Everyone	Only invited users
Collaboration	Open to all	Limited to select people
Best for	Open-source projects	Personal or company work
Public Repos: Good for sharing but open to everyone.
Private Repos: More control, but only invited users can see.


5.Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
A commit is aversion of your project and keeps tracks of changes
open git bash
go to your project folder (cd your-project -folder)
initialize git(git intit)
add files(git add
create a comiit(git commit)
connect to github(git remote add origi<your-repo-url>)
push your code(git push -u origin main)


6.How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
Branch is a copy of the project where channges can be made without affetcting the main version
create a branch;git branch new-feature
switch to it; git checkout new-feature
make changes and commit them
merge it back into the main project

7.Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
Apull request suggest changes before adding them to the main project.
create a new branch and make changes
go to your repo on github and click new pull request
describe your changes and submit the pr
the team reviews and approves the changes
the pr is merged into the main branch
pull requests allow team members to check and approve before merging.

8.Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
Forking creates a seperate copy of someones else's repo under ypur account whil cloning downloads a copy of arepo to your computer but stays linked to the original repo
you fork when contributing to open source projects and when testing changes without affecting the original repo.

9.Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.
GitHub provides Issues and Project Boards to organize work.

Issues:
Report bugs or suggest improvements.
Assign issues to specific team members.
Project Boards:
Organize work into To Do, In Progress, and Done.
Useful for tracking progress.

10.Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?Common Issues:
Forgetting to commit regularly – Changes can be lost or hard to track.
Unclear commit messages – Makes it difficult to understand changes later.
Editing the main branch directly – Can cause conflicts.
Merge conflicts – Happen when two people edit the same file differently.
Best Practices:
Commit often – Saves changes frequently. Use branches – Keeps the main branch stable.
Write clear commit messages – Example: "Fixed layout issue on homepage".
Review code before merging – Reduces errors.
Use pull requests – Allows for feedback before making changes official
